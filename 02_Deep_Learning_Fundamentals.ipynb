    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand the fundamentals of the __perceptron__ algorithm and basic __neural network__ architecture\n",
    "* Apply __PyTorch__ for practical deep learning tasks\n",
    "* Apply __Hugging Face__ for practical deep learning tasks\n",
    "* Use __transfer learning__ to leverage pre-trained models for a variety of machine learning tasks\n",

    "\n",
    "`Perceptron:` A basic computational model in machine learning that makes decisions by weighing input data. It's like a mini-decision maker that labels data as one thing or another.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Binary Classifier:` A type of system that categorizes data into one of two groups. Picture a light switch that can be flipped to either on or off.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Vector of Numbers:` A sequence of numbers arranged in order, which together represent one piece of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Activation Function:` A mathematical equation that decides whether the perceptron's calculated sum from the inputs is enough to trigger a positive or negative output.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP):` A type of artificial neural network that has multiple layers of nodes, each layer learning to recognize increasingly complex features of the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Input Layer:` The first layer in an MLP where the raw data is initially received.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Output Layer:` The last layer in an MLP that produces the final result or prediction of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Hidden Layers:` Layers between the input and output that perform complex data transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Labeled Dataset:` This is a collection of data where each piece of information comes with a correct answer or label. It's like a quiz with the questions and answers already provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Gradient Descent:` This method helps find the best settings for a neural network by slowly tweaking them to reduce errors, similar to finding the lowest point in a valley.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Cost Function:` Imagine it as a score that tells you how wrong your network's predictions are. The goal is to make this score as low as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Learning Rate:` This hyperparameter specifies how big the steps are when adjusting the neural network's settings during training. Too big, and you might skip over the best setting; too small, and it'll take a very long time to get there.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Backpropagation:` Short for backward propagation of errors. This is like a feedback system that tells each part of the neural network how much it contributed to any mistakes, so it can learn and do better next time."
